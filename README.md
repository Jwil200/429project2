# 490project2

## Running
To run the project use the launch.bat file (will automatically use an unused topology) or run with the following commands:
- cd src
- javac -d ../bin Main.java
- java -cp ../bin Main -t topology.txt -i 100
topology.txt can be replaced with any topology file in the topology folder and the interval 100 will work for any interval (measured in seconds).
